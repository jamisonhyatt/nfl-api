# nfl-api
First attempt at an application after taking a Tour of Go.  This makes different calls to undocumented nfl.com api's and stores the results. The intended use of this was to build a complete NFL pick-em application for me and my friends to use.

This is certainly not an API yet.  Currently, it only retrieves and stores NFL team and schedule information into the NFLDB.
